# Koksmat Platform

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the complexity and diversity of the Digital Workplace? Do you wish you had some guidance and support to make your work easier and more efficient? Do you want to collaborate with other professionals who share your passion and challenges? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you might be interested in Koksmat, a project that I have started to offer a helping hand for the Digital Workplace.

Koksmat is a Danish word that means "Chef's assistance". I chose this name because I wanted to convey the idea of providing useful and practical solutions for the Digital Workplace, just like a chef's assistant would do in a kitchen. I also liked the fact that it sounds similar in different languages, and that it has another meaning in English: "Cooks Hand". This inspired me to create a logo with a chef's hat, symbolizing the creativity and expertise that I want to share with you.

In this blog post, I will tell you more about the background and motivation of Koksmat, what kind of solutions I have created and how you can use them, and how you can join me in this project and contribute with your own ideas and feedback. I hope you will find Koksmat useful and enjoyable, and that it will make your Digital Workplace experience more satisfying and productive.

The **Koksmat Platform** is designed to be a scalable, secure, and efficient platform for modern applications. Built on a cloud-native foundation, Koksmat follows best practices in development, deployment, and security. Below is a comprehensive overview of the framework’s architecture, covering everything from development and operations workflows to the technology stack and security model.

---

## 1. Development and Operations

### 1.1. Choice of Database: PostgreSQL

One of the first architectural decisions in building Koksmat was selecting a **relational database** that provides reliability, strong SQL compliance, and extensibility.

- **Robust Feature Set**: PostgreSQL is renowned for advanced features, such as complex queries, indexing, and support for structured and unstructured data.
- **Extensibility**: It offers support for numerous extensions, including JSON, PostGIS (for geospatial data), and more.
- **Reliability & Stability**: PostgreSQL has a long history of stability, broad community support, and proven performance at scale.

### 1.2. DevOps with GitHub

All DevOps and DevAdmin (DevAdm) activities for the Koksmat Platform are conducted via **GitHub**, ensuring a streamlined process from development to production.

- **GitHub Actions**
  - Facilitates continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).
  - Automates tasks such as building, testing, and releasing artifacts whenever code is pushed or pull requests are opened.
- **Webhooks**
  - Enable external services to be triggered by GitHub events (e.g., commits, pull requests).
  - Support custom notifications and integrations for environment orchestration or logging.
- **GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`)**
  - Stores all container images and packages.
  - Provides versioning and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions.
  - Ensures a secure and reliable distribution of images across environments.

## 2. Hosting

### 2.1. Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the orchestration layer for containerized workloads in the Koksmat Platform.

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales pods based on resource utilization or custom metrics.
- **Resilience**: Includes self-healing, rolling updates, and replication to minimize downtime.
- **Portability**: Consistency across on-premises, cloud, or hybrid environments.

### 2.2. Ingress – Caddy

For external traffic routing and load balancing, Koksmat uses **Caddy** as its Ingress controller.

- **ACME Certificates**:
  - Automates TLS certificate issuance and renewal for any number of subdomains.
  - Simplifies HTTPS setup and management.
- **Simple Configuration**:
  - Caddy’s configuration file is straightforward, reducing the complexity often seen with other reverse proxies.
  - Offers features like caching, compression, and more with minimal setup.

### 2.3. Messaging – NATS

Koksmat relies on **NATS** for inter-service communication, ensuring low-latency and robust message delivery.

- **High Performance**: NATS is lightweight and capable of handling large volumes of messages.
- **Flexible Communication Patterns**: Publish/subscribe, request/reply, and streaming options to meet diverse messaging needs.
- **Scalability**: NATS can be clustered to handle massive throughput across distributed systems.

## 3. Security

### 3.1. Zero Trust Approach

Security in the Koksmat Platform follows the **Zero Trust** model, where no entity—internal or external—is automatically trusted.

- **Service-Issued Tokens and Certificates**
  - Each service generates its own tokens or certificates for authentication, ensuring strict access control.
  - Minimizes the attack surface by limiting privileges to only what is necessary.
- **Granular Authorization**
  - Fine-grained access policies define the resources each token can access.
  - Reduces potential damage in case of a breach or compromised credentials.
- **Encryption in Transit**
  - All internal and external communications are encrypted (via mTLS or secure tokens).
  - Preserves data integrity and confidentiality throughout the network.

## 4. Programming Languages and Frameworks

The Koksmat Platform makes use of a blend of modern languages and libraries tailored for both front-end and back-end development, as well as scripting and batch operations.

### 4.1. Front End & Internal APIs

- **TypeScript**
  - Enforces static typing, reducing runtime errors and improving maintainability.
  - Provides a strong developer experience with robust IDE support.
- **Next.js**
  - A React framework offering server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering.
  - Integrates seamlessly with TypeScript and modern CSS frameworks for a cohesive workflow.
- **Tailwind CSS**
  - Utility-first CSS framework that accelerates development and ensures design consistency.
  - Easy to customize and integrates naturally with Next.js.
- **Shadcn**
  - A curated collection of pre-built UI components and React patterns based on Tailwind CSS.
  - Offers a consistent, extensible starting point for designing and prototyping UIs.

These technologies produce fast, interactive UIs for both end-user experiences and internal dashboards. They can also power lightweight APIs through Next.js’ built-in API routes.

### 4.2. Microservices & Production APIs

- **Go (Golang)**
  - Perfect for building performant microservices due to its concurrency model and lightweight runtime.
  - Easily containerized and highly compatible with Kubernetes-based workflows.
  - Clear code structure and memory safety features make it a strong choice for production APIs.

By coupling a TypeScript/Next.js front end with Go-based microservices, Koksmat achieves both a stellar developer experience and robust, high-performance back-end services.

### 4.3. Script and Batch Operations

- **PowerShell**
  - Ideal for Windows-centric scripting tasks, automation, and environment setup.
  - Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines for shared scripts and cross-platform orchestration.
- **Python**
  - Highly versatile and cross-platform for quick scripting, data manipulation, and testing.
  - Leverages a vast library ecosystem to handle specialized tasks efficiently.

### 4.4. Favor Using Existing CLI Tools

Koksmat encourages using proven command-line interfaces (CLI) to reduce complexity and take advantage of widespread community support:

- **gh** (GitHub CLI)
  - Interact with GitHub (issues, PRs, releases) from the command line.
  - Works seamlessly with GitHub Actions and other automation workflows.
- **az** (Microsoft Azure CLI)
  - Manages Azure resources and services for rapid, script-driven cloud deployments.
  - Ensures consistent provisioning and teardown across environments.
- **kubectl** (Kubernetes CLI)
  - The primary tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, deploying applications, and managing resources.
  - Supports GitOps workflows and easily extends via plugins.

By building on these existing CLI tools, developers avoid reinventing the wheel, keeping scripts transparent, maintainable, and easy to debug.
