# Magixbox project

## What is Magixbox?
It is a black box consolidating all the services which I have developed / have to support.

## How is it organized?

Magicbox is organized in the following way:

- `docs`: contains the documentation of the project (this is the project you are currently in)
- `gitops`: contains the source code for the infrastructure 
- `pwsh`: contains the source code for batch orientated jobs
- `ui`: contains the user interfaces
- `koksmat`: contains the source for the REST API exposed by the project as well as a CLI supporting whatever need to be supported
