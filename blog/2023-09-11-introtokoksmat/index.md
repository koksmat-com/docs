# Introducting Koksmat
I like to welcome you to Koksmat. This is not a blog about food and cooking. It is a blog about software development and other things that I like to do. I will try to not only write, but also support you with video and real code.

## Why Koksmat?

Koksmat is a Danish word that means "Chef's assistance". I found it fitting for my purpose as it for most people doesn't mean a thing, it is pronounced identitically in many languages (tested in Serbo Croatian and US languages).

It also reflects to my early life. When I was aged 17, I actually worked as a Koksmat on the ferries crossing from Aarhus to Kalundborg. Remembering preparing a mix of 30 kg potatoes and 10 kg mayonaise together with a 1 kilo of spices, not the coolest dish ever made as the potatoes was poured in from a 3 kg bag.

Another meaning of koksmat is in english "Cooks Hand", which inspired me to inititally make a logo with a hand reaching out to help. But it turned out to look closer so someone begging for food. So I decided to go for the Chefs hat instead.

So this is really about giving each other a helping hand in our daily work.

## Why now?
[TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr); Why not. 

The much longer story is related to my uncertainty about my self. A year a go I got diagnosed with **autisme** which have turned to be a bleshing for me. I really made me understand myself so much better, and also made me super confident that I have some talents which make is possible for me to do what I do.
